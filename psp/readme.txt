This is the old psp build of verge3
It was last dealt with in october 2005.
It will be difficult to get building, and perhaps impossible as the psp sdk is in hot development.
But if you want to try, be sure to get in contact with zeromus@zeromus.org because the odds of you figuring all this out yourself are slim to none.

The res folder is a test verge game which should get copied to the psp (the res folder is where all the verge game files go on the psp). fmod.dll is in there because its fun to drop a copy of win32 verge.exe in there to try out the test game for comparison
